## 2D breakout game using pure JavaScript

- In this step-by-step tutorial we create a simple MDN Breakout game written entirely in pure JavaScript and rendered on HTML5 <canvas>.

Every step has editable, live samples available to play with so you can see what the intermediate stages should look like. You will learn the basics of using the <canvas> element to implement fundamental game mechanics like rendering and moving images, collision detection, control mechanisms, and winning and losing states.

To get the most out of this series of articles you should already have basic to intermediate JavaScript knowledge. After working through this tutorial you should be able to build your own simple Web games.
